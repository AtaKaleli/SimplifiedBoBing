Purpose:

The main purpose of this programming assignment is to revise the topics that we have covered 
including the fundamentals of C programming, conditional statements, repetitive statements, random 
number generations and functions.


Description:

Bo Bing, is a dice game which is played by two players, with each player in succession having a turn at 
throwing the dice. Each player's turn results in a score, and the scores for each player accumulate to 
some winning total.
In this practical assignment, you will create a modified and simplified version of Bo Bing game. This will 
give you practice with all three control constructs (sequence, selection and repetition). We are 
including some design constraints in the "Programming Requirements" section, so you will also use 
functions. This will give you the experience of decomposing a problem into parts, and then 
implementing each part in one highly cohesive, loosely coupled function.
